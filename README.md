Chess Openings Tool - iOS Mobile App

Chess openings are a fundamental aspect of chess. The opening sequence can determine the
outcome of a game despite each player starting from an equal position. Players of all skill ranges
need to learn the basics of openings because you won't need to spend extra time analyzing your
opponent's moves. The Chess Openings Tool is an interactive tool that allows players of all skill
ranges to learn and practice chess openings. In the home view, users can switch between the
learning and drills sections. The home view allows users to scroll through a list of various
openings. Once an opening is selected, the app will show a table view of multiple variations. For
example, if users choose Polish Opening, they will see variations like Sokolsky Opening or
Birmingham Gambit. Once the user selects a variation, the user can scroll through famous
players known for playing that variation, and a demonstration of the rendered opening sequence
is shown below. From this view, users can save the variation, which can be viewed from the
home view under "View Favorite Openings." The drill section allows users to test their lessons in
a timed-style memorization quiz. Once a drill begins, the user will have limited time to identify
various variations of openings, gaining points for each one they identify correctly. Once time
runs out, the results are then displayed and saved persistently.
